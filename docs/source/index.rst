osmo documentation
==================

osmo is a digital signage framework for minimalists. It doesn't provide you
with anything fancy, just a web interface to upload images to display, and a
client to display them with.

The client can run anywhere there is a web browser that supports SSE -- it
doesn't require any installation.
